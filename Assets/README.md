Because the updating of Scripts and other Assets such as .FBX, it can become confusing for people looking for specific stuff,
so here I'll stipulate some important details about these:

**CameraScript**: Script that moves the camera based on the position of two GO: gerardo1 & gerardo2.
	- (In case of doubt or something not working as expected, ask Pol Bosch)
**Geralt_v1**: The first version of Geralt, includes basic animations and 1 light and 1 heavy attacks.
	- Uses GeraltScript_v1 to function. This pair of .lua and .FBX is the backup for the Vertical Slice in case "_v2" isn't finished.
**Geralt_v2**: The second version of Geralt, with most of the animations and 3 light and 3 heavy different attacks.
	- Uses GeraltScript_v2 to function in build version older than 0.2.5 (not included).
**Geralt_v3**: Includes all animations + requested modifications in some of them.
	- Uses GeraltScript_v3.
	
**GeraltScript_v1**: First Script version with Geralt_v1.
**GeraltScript_v2**: Second Script version, only up to build 0.2.4 with Geralt_v2.
**GeraltScript_v3**: Third Script version, new namespaces (0.2.5 and up) with Geralt_v3.
