Because the updating of Scripts and other Assets such as .FBX, it can become confusing for people looking for specific stuff,
so here I'll stipulate some important details about these:

**CameraScript**: Script that moves the camera based on the position of two GO: gerardo1 & gerardo2.
	- (In case of doubt or something not working as expected, ask Pol Bosch)
**Geralt_v1**: The first version of Geralt, includes basic animations and 1 light and 1 heavy attacks.
	- Uses GeraltScript_Old to function. This pair of .lua and .FBX is the backup for the Vertical Slice in case "_v2" isn't finished.
**Geralt_v2**: The second version of Geralt, with most of the animations and 3 light and 3 heavy different attacks.
	- Uses GeraltScript to function, but is under construction and some features might be missing or broken.
**Geralt_v3**: Includes all animations + requested modifications in some of them.
	- Planned to use GeraltScript, but not done yet.
